    <h1>âœ¨Monday, February 3, 2025âœ¨</h1>
    <h3>Gotta start the week of strong!</h3>
    <p>
      Today's glimmer would be best enjoyed on your drive to work or your drive
      home. But of course you can listen to it whenever you want! I know you
      enjoy a good bop, and I find this is one of the best songs to help put a
      little extra pep in my step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you really think I'd let you get very far into the week without
      bringing up Taylor Swift?? ðŸŽ¶
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope you enjoy this song.
      <br />
      I hope it helps start your Monday off right.
      <br />
      And I hope it makes you think of me. ðŸ¥°
